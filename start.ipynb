    "Data investigations can get complicated and you might not know where to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll introduce you to a planning checklist that we use for our own investigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The checklist will help you choose an accountability target, identify tangible harms, and form a testable hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, the checklist covers questions you'll need to answer in order to develop a defensible methodology and a bullet-proof story. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### _bullet-proofing_ is _hater-proofing_\n",
    "Your readers and future self will thank you for being forthright about your investigation's limitations, and addressing potential vulnerabilities proactively. Moreover, you'll get a sense of the experiment's feasibility before you invest too much time into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions in the checklist cover fundamental topics we'll discuss throughout the practitioner's guide such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data collection<br>\n",
    "2. Viability (minimal viable) analyses<br>\n",
    "3. Classification<br>\n",
    "4. Statistical tests<br>\n",
    "5. Limitations<br>\n",
    "6. Communicating findings for a general audience<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't need to fill out a checklist for every story, but it is **necessary for projects with original data collection and/or analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it sounds grim, the checklist helps you expedite the decision to kill a story. It can be a difficult process, but one we all make. Doing so before your invest too much time is a gift to yourself and your colleagues. There's even a [podcast about this very topic](https://killedstories.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, view the checklist is a starting point. Add and edit questions with your team to assure you can publish your findings with certainty."
